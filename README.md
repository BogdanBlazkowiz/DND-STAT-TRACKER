# DND-STAT-TRACKER

Extremely basic information tracker, made it back before I learned about mongoDb and databases in general, so the storing of the information is clunky.

## Why?
Got tired of notepad

## How to install?
Simply grab the folder that applies to you, and open dnd-stat-tracker.exe, it'll pop up in your browser and be ready to go!

## How to use?
Fill out the sheet(s) with the necessary information about the characters on first use. The download button will save all the information to a json file, hold on to it.
When starting the page again, it'll be blank, use the browse button and the import button to first navigate and select the json file, then apply the json's values to the sheet(s).
The long rest button sets health and spell slots to their maximum as detailed in the sheet(s).
