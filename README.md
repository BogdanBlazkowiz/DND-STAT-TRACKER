# DND-STAT-TRACKER

## Why?
Got tired of notepad

## How to install?
Simply grab the folder that applies to you, and use your browser of choice to open the index.html file inside. (Firefox has some permission issues, so if you use it, most likely will need some error searching online to fix it)

## How to use?
Fill out the sheet with the necessary information about the characters on first use. The download button will save all the information to a json file, hold on to it.
When starting the page again, it'll be blank, use the browse button and the import button to first navigate and select the json file, then use it to fill out the sheets.
The long rest button sets health and spell slots to their maximum as detailed in the sheets.
